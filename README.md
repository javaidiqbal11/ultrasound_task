# Ultrasound Signal Processing and Beamforming

This repository contains materials and code related to ultrasound signal processing, specifically focusing on beamforming techniques. The content is designed to assist in understanding and implementing beamforming algorithms for ultrasound data.

## Main Contents

- **Programming Assignment.pdf**: A detailed programming assignment outlining tasks related to ultrasound beamforming.
- **PA_starter.m**: A MATLAB starter script provided for the programming assignment.
- **PA_starter.py**: A Python starter script provided for the programming assignment.
- **beamform_ultrasound.py**: A Python script containing functions and methods to perform beamforming on ultrasound data.
- **load_ultrasound_data.py**: A Python script to load and preprocess ultrasound data for beamforming.
- **visualize_rf_data.py**: A Python script to visualize radiofrequency (RF) ultrasound data.
- **requirements.txt**: A file listing the Python dependencies required to run the scripts.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by git.

## Getting Started

To get started with the provided materials, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.12**: The scripts are written in Python and require Python 3.x to run.
- **MATLAB**: If you prefer using MATLAB, the `PA_starter.m` script is available.

### Python Dependencies

Install the necessary Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the required packages to run the Python scripts.

### Data Preparation

Before running the beamforming algorithms, you need to have ultrasound RF data. Ensure that your data is in the correct format expected by the scripts. The `load_ultrasound_data.py` script provides functions to load and preprocess the data.

### Running the Beamforming Script

Use the `beamform_ultrasound.py` script to perform beamforming on your ultrasound data. Ensure that you have loaded your data correctly using the `load_ultrasound_data.py` script.

Example:

```bash
python beamform_ultrasound.py
```


This will process the loaded ultrasound data and apply the beamforming algorithm.

### Visualizing RF Data

To visualize the RF ultrasound data, use the `visualize_rf_data.py` script. This will help you understand the structure and quality of the data before and after processing.

Example:

```bash
python visualize_rf_data.py
```


This will generate visual representations of the RF data, aiding in analysis and debugging.

## Notes

- The provided starter scripts (`PA_starter.m` and `PA_starter.py`) are templates to help you begin the programming assignment. Modify and expand these scripts as needed to complete the tasks outlined in the assignment.
- Ensure that your ultrasound data is compatible with the provided scripts. You may need to adjust the data loading and preprocessing steps based on your specific dataset.
- The `requirements.txt` file lists all necessary Python packages. Ensure that these are installed to avoid compatibility issues.
